# What?

Scraper and Database for gathering data on current NFL players

# Why?

Initally started as a way of creating the perfect fantasy football team. My hypothesis was that a team consisting of players that minimize overall variance would have the best chance of winning.

# How?

Scrapes data on current NFL players and then puts it into a MySQL database for further analysis.
I've included a copy of the database schema and a dump of the data to do your analysis with as well in `nfl_schema.sql` and `nfl.sql`.
